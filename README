A rather simple X11 window manager. Core features:

    - Tiling and floating
    - Title bars and theming
    - Per-screen workspaces, per-workspace layouts
    - Application rules, layout save slots (during runtime)
    - No sloppy focus
    - Basic ICCCM and EWMH support
    - Non-reparenting

Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required at runtime:

    - libx11
    - libxft
    - libxrandr

katriawm expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local, please use GNU make:

    $ cd src/
    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

katriawm comprises two core components: The actual window manager and a
client to control the manager. First, you run the WM via your ~/.xinitrc
or similar:

    $ katriawm

katriawm provides no means of specifying key bindings. I suggest using
sxhkd (version 0.5.5 is recommended -- later versions lack important
mouse events):

    https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd

Please configure sxhkd (or the tool of your choice) to launch the
client. Here's an example:

    super + {button1,!button1,@button1}
        katriac client_move_mouse {down,motion,up}

    super + {button3,!button3,@button3}
        katriac client_resize_mouse {down,motion,up}

    super + {h,l}
        katriac workspace_select {prev,next}

    ...

katriawm publishes some of its internal state as a property on the root
window. You can use this to draw a "pager". I wrote bevelbar to be used
together with katriawm, its look matches katriawm's default theme:

    https://github.com/vain/bevelbar

A tool, which you can use in your ~/.xinitrc to read and evaluate that
property, is provided:

    $ katriabi | bevelbar ...

As real world examples, you can have a look at my setup:

Customization
-------------

You can configure some behaviour in config.h files at compile time.
Additionally, you must provide a theme.h at compile time which contains
window decorations, their layout, colors, and fonts. Some themes are
provided in the themes/ subdirectory.

 Credits

  katriawm was written from scratch. However, as I've been using dwm for
  several years, many parts of katriawm are heavily inspired by dwm and
  some routines have indeed been copied.

  So, many thanks to dwm and all its authors!

 About the name

  Katria is a character from the game Skyrim. You encounter her in a
  little side quest. The name not only sounds nice, but also reflects some
  properties of this program.

  In the game, it's just a side quest. No big story, no massive impact.
  Similarly, katriawm is just a simple window manager. It does not try to
  introduce new concepts that will revolutionize the world.

  You help Katria find ancient ruins. Likewise, katriawm's default theme
  was inspired by the Motif Window Manager which was written in the
  early-1980s.
