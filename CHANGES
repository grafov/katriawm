  [Fixed]
  - Critical: Fix "use after free" when a client terminates or unmaps.
  - More robust against nonsensical data received from the IPC client.
    In other words: Added various out-of-bounds checks.
  - Fix focus issues with suckless tabbed after changing workspaces or
    monitors.

  [Changed]
  - On startup, the pointer is now warped to the selected monitor.

Milestone 2  2016-01-01
  [Fixed]
  - Moving and resizing works when pointer over decorations.
  - Floating windows don't appear on the wrong monitor after XRandR
    changes.
  - Fix focus issues: Kick last remains of sloppy focus.
  - Fullscreen mode now works properly.
  - Duplicate monitors (i.e., monitors with the same x, y offset and
    same width, height) are now ignored. These areas act like they are
    one single monitor.
  - Fix: When clients spawn on an invisible workspace, they are now
    focus-able.

  [Changed]
  - Motif theme is "lighter".
  - Workspace indexes begin at 0, default workspace is 1.
  - Selecting monitors wraps around.
  - Tiling layout has "useless gaps" by default and acts more like a
    grid than traditional master/slave tiling.

  [Added]
  - Application rule matching in config.h.
  - IPC calls: "Toggle floating" and "clear all visible urgency hints".
  - Save slots.
