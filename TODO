--- Near Future ---

- Test on different architectures
- Refactor: There is no need for "monitors" being a list. It's just a
  dwm-ism that complicates things for us. Monitors aren't added/removed
  all the time like clients. We should make "monitors" a calloc'd array.
- Refactor: manage_apply_rules() is bad. This can be shortened and
  simplified.
- Refactor: ipc_client_resize_mouse() duplicates a lot of code from
  ipc_client_move_mouse().
- ICCCM:
    - Support aspect ratios and increments.
        - Once we support ratios and increments, we can allow floaters
          to resize themselves. (If we don't honour their size hints,
          then there's a lot of flickering going on when manually
          resizing such a client: Some clients (VTE) notice that their
          size hints are being ignored, so they try to fit the window by
          themselves.)
- Respect EWMH fullscreen in manage().


--- Ideas ---

- katriac could check for _KATRIA_STATE being present on the root
  window. If not, sleep for 0.5 seconds and try again.
- katriarc, a client for supplying runtime configuration. Would have to
  work the way herbstclient does (creating a window). Would free you
  from the need to recompile and reexec katriawm. Adds a lot of
  complexity, though.
- More IPC calls:
    - Jump to workspace N on monitor M.
    - Show workspace N on monitor M without jumping to it.
    - Wipe all save slots?
    - Move all clients to selected monitor (keeping their workspaces).
- EWMH:
    - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and _NET_CLIENT_LIST if there's a really good
      reason to support them.
