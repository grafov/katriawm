TODO items and future ideas.

- Test on different architectures
- improve theming
    - centered text
    - fix rendering of tiny windows (overlapping parts)
- katriarc, a client for supplying runtime configuration. Would have to
  work the way herbstclient does (creating a window). Would free you
  from the need to recompile and reexec katriawm. Adds a lot of
  complexity, though.
- More IPC calls:
    - Jump to workspace N on monitor M?
    - Wipe all save slots?
    - Move all clients to selected monitor (keeping their workspaces).
- EWMH:
    - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and _NET_CLIENT_LIST if there's a really good
      reason to support them.
- Motif WM hints and add the concept of undecorated windows? (Think
  Gtk's CSDs or Chromium or some Java popups ...)
