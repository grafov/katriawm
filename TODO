It's bug hunting time!


--- Future ---

Next "sprint":

    - WM_TAKE_FOCUS:
        http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1104/7548.html#replies
    - WM_STATE
    - Don't switch workspace if it hasn't actually changed?
    - Merge unmanage() and manage_client_gone()
    - IPC
        - Center floaters
        - Maximize floaters
        - Collect floaters, i.e. fit them to current monitor
    - publish_state():
        - Save slots
        - Selected monitor

Next "sprint":

    - std types
        - Images: We need 32 bit integers, not just integers!
    - EWMH
        - Active window
        - Client list on root window
        - Hints on decoration windows so stuff like compton can ignore
          them
    - ICCCM
        - WM_NORMAL_HINTS
            - should fix GIMP dialogs not resizing themselves
        - InputOnly, see WM_TAKE_FOCUS above
    - Learn about "withdrawn" state. How should the WM handle that? See
      also dwm's UnmapNotify handler.
    - scan():
        - Grab server?
        - Pick up iconified windows?

Next "sprint":

    - Test on BSD
    - Test on different architectures
    - Refactor: There is no need for "monitors" being a list. It's just
      a dwm-ism that complicates things for us. Monitors aren't
      added/removed all the time like clients. We should make "monitors"
      a calloc'd array.
    - Refactor: manage_apply_rules() is bad. This can be shortened and
      simplified.
    - Refactor: Rename "selc" to something like "focus_head". "selc" is
      not only "the currently selected client" but refers to the focus
      list.
    - Refactor: Add one function to clear urgency hints, kill code
      duplication.
    - Refactor: ipc_client_resize_mouse() duplicates a lot of code from
      ipc_client_move_mouse().
