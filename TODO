- Test on different architectures
- katriarc, a client for supplying runtime configuration. Would have to
  work the way herbstclient does (creating a window). Would free you
  from the need to recompile and reexec katriawm. Adds a lot of
  complexity, though.
- More IPC calls:
    - Jump to workspace N on monitor M?
    - Wipe all save slots?
    - Move all clients to selected monitor (keeping their workspaces).
- EWMH:
    - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and _NET_CLIENT_LIST if there's a really good
      reason to support them.
        - If we do this, we should also set _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK,
