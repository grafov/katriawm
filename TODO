--- Near Future ---

- Test on BSD
- Test on different architectures
- Create and test asymmetrical theme (top != bottom already works, test
  left != right)
- Refactor: There is no need for "monitors" being a list. It's just a
  dwm-ism that complicates things for us. Monitors aren't added/removed
  all the time like clients. We should make "monitors" a calloc'd array.
- Refactor: manage_apply_rules() is bad. This can be shortened and
  simplified.
- Refactor: Rename "selc" to something like "focus_head". "selc" is not
  only "the currently selected client" but refers to the focus list.
- Refactor: Add one function to clear urgency hints, kill code
  duplication.
- Refactor: ipc_client_resize_mouse() duplicates a lot of code from
  ipc_client_move_mouse().


--- Ideas ---

- katriac could check for _KATRIA_STATE being present on the root
  window. If not, sleep for 0.5 seconds and try again.
- katriarc, a client for supplying runtime configuration. Would have to
  work the way herbstclient does (creating a window). Would free you
  from the need to recompile and reexec katriawm. Adds a lot of
  complexity, though.
- More IPC calls:
    - Jump to workspace N on monitor M.
    - Show workspace N on monitor M without jumping to it.
    - Wipe all save slots?
- EWMH:
    - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and _NET_CLIENT_LIST if there's a really good
      reason to support them.
- ICCCM:
    - Support aspect ratios and increments if there's a really good
      reason to do so. They're mainly eye candy.
